Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

This project is a banking app that takes user input for investments and outputs interest and totals.

What did you do particularly well?

I think this code is concise and reuasble. It is short clean code that can be easily transferred to other applications.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

This code could be more secure and have a better UX. In the future I could upgrade the menu with something more attractive to the end user.

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

Some of the logic was a little confusing at first. I reinforced my knowledge using YouTube tutorials and studying the resources provided in the course.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

the logic and menu system of this project are reusable and easily transferrable to other applications.

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

I kept this program simple and clean to reach these goals.
